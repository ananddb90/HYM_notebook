# Hybrid Modeling Tutorial


Hybrid Modeling is a modeling technique in which a physics-based model is combined with a data-based approach. 
By combining the best of both worlds, we trade off the benefit of prior knowledge when training data is scarce with the flexibility of a data-driven approaches when training data is abundant. 
In this notebook we demonstrate the power of hybrid modeling by modeling data, which roughly follows the amplitude of a non-linearly damped oscillator with missing data.
